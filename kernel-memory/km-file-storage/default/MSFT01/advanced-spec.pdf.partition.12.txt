four (4) evidence artifacts:
• Signed Statements of Work (SOWs) for all projects
• Solution Design Documents for all projects
• The Project Plan and Migration and Deployment sequence
• Architecture Diagrams
• High-level Designs (HLDs) and Low-level Designs (LLDs)

4.2 Database Migrations
The partner must provide evidence of their ability to migrate databases to Azure with customer
approved designs choosing one (1) of the options for deployment from each of the following
two (2) scenario lists.
Scenario 1: Migrations to AZURE SQL
o Rehosting from SQL Server on-premises or from another public cloud to SQL IaaS on Azure.
o Replatforming from SQL Server on-premises or from another public cloud to SQL
platform as a service (PaaS) on Azure (SQL Database or SQL Managed Instance, or
Azure Arc). *
o Replatform from Oracle to Azure SQL IaaS or PaaS.
*Note: Azure includes Microsoft datacenters, Arc enabled Azure on-prem or Arc enabled multi-cloud 
Scenario 2: Migrations to Azure Open-Source Databases and Cosmos DB
o Replatform Oracle to Azure Database for PostgreSQL
o Replatform or rehost PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL*
o Replatform or rehost MariaDB to Azure SQL Database for MariaDB
o Replatform or rehost MySQL to Azure SQL Database for MySQL
o Replatform or rehost Cassandra to Azure Cosmos DB or Azure Managed Instance for
Apache Cassandra
o Replatform or rehost MongoDB to Azure Cosmos DB
*Note: Azure includes Microsoft datacenters, Arc enabled Azure on-prem or Arc enabled multi-cloud 
Required Evidence:
The projects shown for this control must be the same as in Control 3.1. The partner must
provide evidence of their ability to migrate databases to Azure with customer approved
designs, choosing one (1) of the options for deployment from each of the above two (2)
scenario lists for a minimum of two (2) unique customers. To cover the entire sequence,
including design and production deployment, the documentation must include at least two
(2) of the following items for each customer project, totaling four (4) evidence artifacts
required:25 
o Signed Statements of Work (SOWs) for the projects
o Solution Design Documents for all projects
o The Project Plan with Migration and Deployment sequence
o Architecture Diagrams
o High-level Designs (HLDs) and Low-level Designs (LLDs)
o As built documentation
4.3 Migration Tools
The partner must demonstrate the specific products, tools, or scripts that were used for the
assessment and migration of customer workloads. The partner must demonstrate the customer
accepted the migration approach by showing confirmation from the customer. 
Required Evidence:
Partners must provide documentation and prove customer migration tool experience with at
least one (1) of the following options through a demonstration of tools using (A, B, or C):
A. Show experience with using native Azure migration tools by providing a step-by-
step demonstration that they can effectively use at least four (4) of the following
tools:
• Azure Migrate Server Assessment for VMware and Hyper-V
• Data Migration Assistant (DMA)
• SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA)
• Azure Migrate Server Migration VMware and Hyper-V (use of Azure Site Recovery
is also accepted)
• Azure Database Migration Service
• Storage Migration Service B. Show experience with third-party tools that integrate with Azure Migrate by demonstrating a
customer project where assessment data is available from Azure Migrate or available to them
offline and they perform the migration by using third-party tooling.
C. Show experience with all other third-party tools by referencing the tools used in a project plan
for successfully migrating a customer to Azure, or by providing a spreadsheet with output from
