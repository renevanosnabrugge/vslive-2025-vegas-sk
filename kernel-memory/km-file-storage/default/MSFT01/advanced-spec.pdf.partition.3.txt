Audit roles
Role of the auditor 
The auditor reviews submitted evidence and objectively assesses whether the evidence provided by the partner
satisfies the audit checklist requirements. The auditor selects and evaluates evidence, based on samples of the
information available from live systems. The appropriate use of such sampling is closely related to the confidence
that can be placed in the audit conclusions. All ISSI auditors are under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with
Microsoft. Auditors will also comply with requests from partners to sign a direct NDA. 
Role of the partner 
The partner must provide objective evidence that satisfies the auditor for all checklist items. It is the responsibility of
the partner to have reviewed all check-list items prior to the audit, to have collected all necessary documentation and
evidence, and to have ensured that the right subject matter experts are available to discuss and show systems, as
appropriate. All audit evidence must be reproducible and verifiable.
Role of the Microsoft Partner Development Manager 
For partners that have an assigned Microsoft Partner Development Manager (PDM), the PDM is responsible for ensuring
that the partner fully understands the requirements prior to applying for the audit. The PDM may attend the optional
consulting engagements that ISSI offers, but the PDM and other Microsoft FTEs may not attend the audit.
