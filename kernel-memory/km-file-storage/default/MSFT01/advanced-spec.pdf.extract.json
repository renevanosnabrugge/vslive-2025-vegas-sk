It also provides further requirements, guidelines, and an audit checklist for the associated audit\r\nthat is required to earn this Azure specialization. \r\nThe Infra and Database Migration to Microsoft Azure Specialization is designed for partners to demonstrate\r\ndeep knowledge, experience, and success in planning and migrating their customer\u2019s infrastructure and\r\ndatabase workloads to Azure. Partners with demonstrated expertise across both Windows Server and SQL\r\nServer and across Linux and Open-Source database migration to Microsoft Azure may apply.\r\nThe Infra and Database Migration to Microsoft Azure Specialization allows partners with an active Solutions\r\nPartner for Infrastructure designation or Solutions Partner for Data \u0026 AI designation to demonstrate their\r\ncapabilities, build stronger connections with customers and differentiate their organizations in Infrastructure\r\nand Database migration. \r\nPartners who meet the comprehensive requirements to earn an Azure Specialization, receive a customer-\r\nfacing label they can display, badge and a business profile in Microsoft AppSource partner gallery.\r\nIn AppSource, access to specific Microsoft go-to-market programs is prioritized in customer searches\r\nto help drive new business. Partners can also generate a certified letter from Microsoft that verifies\r\nthe Azure specializations that they have earned. For these reasons, this opportunity is available only\r\nto partners that meet additional, stringent requirements. \r\nPlease note: This specialization requires 3rd party certifications to proceed to audit unless you are approved\r\nfor the alternate Module B pathway option. These certifications are found in Module B Control 1.1.\r\nHow to apply\r\nOnly a Microsoft AI Cloud Account Administrator or a Global Administrator of an organization\u2019s Microsoft\r\npartner account can submit an application for the Azure specialization on behalf of the organization.\r\nPartners with the appropriate role and access permissions can apply. To do so, they sign into their Partner\r\nCenter account. On the left pane, select Azure under the Specialization section.

The auditor selects and evaluates evidence, based on samples of the\r\ninformation available from live systems. The appropriate use of such sampling is closely related to the confidence\r\nthat can be placed in the audit conclusions. All ISSI auditors are under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with\r\nMicrosoft. Auditors will also comply with requests from partners to sign a direct NDA. \r\nRole of the partner \r\nThe partner must provide objective evidence that satisfies the auditor for all checklist items. It is the responsibility of\r\nthe partner to have reviewed all check-list items prior to the audit, to have collected all necessary documentation and\r\nevidence, and to have ensured that the right subject matter experts are available to discuss and show systems, as\r\nappropriate. All audit evidence must be reproducible and verifiable.\r\nRole of the Microsoft Partner Development Manager \r\nFor partners that have an assigned Microsoft Partner Development Manager (PDM), the PDM is responsible for ensuring\r\nthat the partner fully understands the requirements prior to applying for the audit. The PDM may attend the optional\r\nconsulting engagements that ISSI offers, but the PDM and other Microsoft FTEs may not attend the audit. \r\nAudit Process: High-level overview \r\nStep Action Responsibility\r\n1 Review: Specialization requirements in Partner Center.

The duration of an audit is four (4) hours for Module B\r\nworkloads and eight (8) hours for Module A\u002BB audits combined, depending upon the scope of the audit. \r\nDuring the audit, the partner must provide access to the appropriate personnel who can discuss and\r\ndisclose evidence that demonstrates compliance with program requirements. We highly recommend that\r\nsubject matter experts for each section attend as well as a person who is familiar with the entire audit. \r\nOn the day of the audit, the partner must be prepared to provide the auditor with access to live\r\ndemonstrations, documents, and personnel, as necessary to demonstrate compliance with the\r\nrequirements. During the audit, the auditor will seek to verify that the partner\u2019s evidence has addressed\r\nall required audit checklist items satisfactorily.\r\nA note on audit checklist effective dates: Partners are audited against the checklist items that are active on\r\nthe date of their remote audit, not the date they apply.

The auditor is looking to see how a document\r\nwas created, where it is located, and what source materials were used to create the document. By probing for\r\nmore information, the auditor evaluates and validates that the partner is operating at an advanced level. This\r\ncan only be done by questioning during the audit. This approach is explained to the partner during the\r\nopening meeting.\r\nAcceptable evidence: Excerpts, exhibit file formats and use of PowerPoints \r\nPowerPoints are a common and accepted format for presenting a high-level overview of a partner\u2019s systems.\r\nHowever, please also be prepared to present live demonstrations from source files so that the auditor may\r\nconfirm that the systems in place are mature and effective.
